## Project Background
We are a small group of individuals brought together by a shared interest.

The motivation behind this project is to explore how an alternative AI model performs when applied to real-world random events, which based on a different way of thinking, that distinct from existing brute-force probabilistic models.

Our goal is to observe the performance of specific types of AI models in lottery prediction scenarios, particularly by focusing on how accurate certain reference indicators (or "strategies") are, and to what extent can the models describe certain features.

We are fully aware that with current mathematical tools, statistical methods, and algorithmic technologies, it is impossible to predict lottery outcomes with complete accuracy.

We are fully aware that with current mathematical tools, statistical methods, and algorithmic technologies, it is impossible to predict lottery outcomes with complete accuracy.
Some believe the lottery is entirely random, others think certain features tend to converge toward fixed values, while some suggest the lottery is controlled by some unknown high-dimensional deity or manipulated by human hands.

Our approach is to evaluate lottery behavior using a set of strategic indicators, driven by an AI model rooted in this alternative mode of thinking, and generate recommendation results accordingly.
We do not judge outcomes solely based on high or low scores. Instead, we observe the model’s performance across multiple strategies to identify patterns or anomalies.

Currently, we are using China’s Sports Lottery “Daletou” (超级大乐透) as our case study.
In the future, we will also provide observational data on China’s Welfare Lottery “Shuangseqiu” (双色球), as well as international lotteries like PowerBall and Mega Millions.

We have limited computing resources, with currently just only two servers on working, and Our progress is powered by passion.
We appreciate your understanding if certain data or results are not released promptly.

Through these real-world examples, we aim to refine this alternative-thinking AI model, which reuire less computing power to accomplish the tasks than the AI models of current types have, also even the tasks current models are incapable of performing.

That is our passion .

We also welcome valuable insights or data contributions via the 
Discussions section, to help us improve this alternative-thinking AI model and also the strategies pools.

If the results we release can be helped giving you more inspires, or provide useful assistance, we’ll consider that as a great honor!

If it happens because of it, to increase your luck points or to you even win a jackpot, please don’t forget to share the good news with us!

Wishing you the jackpot of your dreams!

## Project Value  

If your luck value is a when performing manual calculations, using this AI model can amplify your luck value, reducing the burden of manual calculations, given the same strategy.

As the AI ​​model is developed and refined, the strategy collection for this project will continue to grow (currently over 100).

A wealth of data is available for reference.

⚠️ Important Note

Note:

This cannot achieve 100% accuracy. Any claims of exaggerated accuracy increases are fraudulent.

This project aims to make life more interesting and does not encourage gambling addiction or the use of data as a basis for increased betting.

This project is a supplementary product of our AI model development and can be considered a "sweet" application. You should be aware that AI models have broad applications and are not limited to lottery scenarios.
## Data Format  
Simple Version (Non-Technical Explanation)

Data Storage Instructions
1.1 The data is stored in the data folder. The data format can be downloaded and opened in Excel.
<img width="3390" height="924" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d624b97e-3fad-4597-959a-1599e53b2e2f" />

1.2 The data folder contains statistics provided by the AISI model for each draw, along with predictions for the next draw, which haven't been drawn yet.
Users are generally only interested in the predictions for the latest draw. You can find the latest draw by looking at the markers in the image.

1.3 The latest issue contains data derived using various methods. Each table corresponds to a derivation method, which has been condensed into four major categories, each with two subcategories.

(The image is a high-resolution version and may display slowly under certain network conditions. Click to enlarge.)

Brief Explanation:
The columns represent the data for each period.
The colors represent the actual numbers for each period.
The leftmost column represents the calculated data and numbers for the latest period.
You can make your own inferences based on the actual number performance and the calculated data.
Each table represents the results of each strategy set.
Specific Explanation:

2.1) Box 1 in the example image indicates:
The top row of the table represents the period number, with the leftmost row representing the latest period. In the example image, [25079] represents the latest period, and [25079+1] represents the derivation of the latest period for the next period.

2.2) Box 2 in the example image indicates:
The leftmost column of the table represents the derivation of the latest period for the next period, arranged from largest to smallest.

2.3) Box 3 in the example image indicates:
The derivation of the latest period for the next period, Derived Numbers

2.4) Box 4 in the example image indicates:
Numbers in the derived period, latest period, previous periods, and derived values ​​using the same strategy.

2.5) Box 5 in the example image indicates:
Derived values ​​for each number pair from previous periods. The colored numbers represent the actual numbers drawn in each period. The numbers are on the far left of the row content section (note that Excel automatically adds row numbers to the content section for sorting).

Detailed Version (Technical Explanation Version)
Q1: Why not provide the final, comprehensive data, synthesizing it into a "ultimate" spreadsheet?
Each method may contain "hundreds of basic algorithms + dozens of inference methods + several independent neural network models." Because the various methods are aggregated, the resulting data for each issue is enormous, approximately 10GB. This data cannot be uploaded simultaneously. We can only condense it and upload the final results from a few broad categories.
Currently, the ultimate method is not yet accurate enough and requires further refinement.
Combining it into a single version will lose a significant amount of information.
Therefore, the best approach is to upload a small amount of condensed results within a manageable range, providing as much information as humanly possible. These spreadsheets can also provide a reference for users making their final choices.

Q2: What do the colored numbers in the Excel spreadsheet mean?
For non-technical users, just be sure to check that the colored numbers are genuine. The numbers for the China Sports Lottery Super Lotto are represented as follows:
