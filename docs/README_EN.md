#project-background

We are a small group of individuals brought together by a shared interest.

The motivation behind this project is to explore how an alternative AI model performs when applied to real-world random events, which based on a different way of thinking, that distinct from existing brute-force probabilistic models.

Our goal is to observe the performance of specific types of AI models in lottery prediction scenarios, particularly by focusing on how accurate certain reference indicators (or "strategies") are, and to what extent can the models describe certain features.

We are fully aware that with current mathematical tools, statistical methods, and algorithmic technologies, it is impossible to predict lottery outcomes with complete accuracy.

We are fully aware that with current mathematical tools, statistical methods, and algorithmic technologies, it is impossible to predict lottery outcomes with complete accuracy.
Some believe the lottery is entirely random, others think certain features tend to converge toward fixed values, while some suggest the lottery is controlled by some unknown high-dimensional deity or manipulated by human hands.

Our approach is to evaluate lottery behavior using a set of strategic indicators, driven by an AI model rooted in this alternative mode of thinking, and generate recommendation results accordingly.
We do not judge outcomes solely based on high or low scores. Instead, we observe the model’s performance across multiple strategies to identify patterns or anomalies.

Currently, we are using China’s Sports Lottery “Daletou” (超级大乐透) as our case study.
In the future, we will also provide observational data on China’s Welfare Lottery “Shuangseqiu” (双色球), as well as international lotteries like PowerBall and Mega Millions.

We have limited computing resources, with currently just only two servers on working, and Our progress is powered by passion.
We appreciate your understanding if certain data or results are not released promptly.

Through these real-world examples, we aim to refine this alternative-thinking AI model, which reuire less computing power to accomplish the tasks than the AI models of current types have, also even the tasks current models are incapable of performing.

That is our passion .

We also welcome valuable insights or data contributions via the 
Discussions section, to help us improve this alternative-thinking AI model and also the strategies pools.

If the results we release can be helped giving you more inspires, or provide useful assistance, we’ll consider that as a great honor!

If it happens because of it, to increase your luck points or to you even win a jackpot, please don’t forget to share the good news with us!

Wishing you the jackpot of your dreams!
